# For the Developer

Create a file named .env in the root folder of the project and add the env variable for `REACT_APP_TMDB_API_KEY`. This cannot be added to the git repository. 

When ever this file is changed, the project must be rebuilt; the development server must be started again.

Note: This property name must always be started with `REACT_APP_` in order to be recogonised by React.
